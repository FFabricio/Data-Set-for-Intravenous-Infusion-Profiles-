# Data-Set-for-Intravenous-Infusion-Profiles-
Drug delivery data for intravenous infusions, for medical devices by gravitational infusion and by infusion pumps.
The Dataset of the profiles for the delivery of intravenous drugs, has the data on the sensing of the behavior of four types of volumes of drugs to be delivered, by gravitational infusions and infusion pumps. Which, was composed by the following volumes: [125, 250, 500, 1000 mL].

The data set available, has more than 3969 hours of infusions totaling 238146 samples, and 926 types of profiles with different flow rates have been explored.

The Datase has information of the features and targets data for each type of infusion device. Where the features are records of the sensing that represents the behavior of the infusion profile for a sequence of time windows of 60 seconds. The features column labels are, (TimeWin0) indicates the beginning of the time window and (TimeWin59) its end. The targets is represented by the column label (Rate), which corresponds to the speed of the flow profile of the infusion in (mL/h), for the different features registers.
